# ADB WIFI
    
Added script to start adb over wifi for attached Android device.
The script gets the ip of wlan0. Start adb tcpip on port 5555,
then connects. It is assumed that the device is the only
Android device attached.
    
Future improvements will add port parameter and ability to
chose device.
